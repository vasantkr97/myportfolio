# Integrating E2B and Daytona: Cloud Sandboxes for Next-Gen AI Development

Picture this: You're building an AI agent that can write and execute code on the fly. Sounds amazing, right? But then reality hits—what if that code is malicious or just buggy? How do you run it safely without compromising your entire system?

As someone who's wrestled with these exact challenges in AI development, I can tell you that secure code execution isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential. The rise of AI agents and dynamic code generation has fundamentally changed how we approach this problem. In 2025, two platforms have emerged as frontrunners: **E2B** and **Daytona**. They both tackle the same core issue—running untrusted code safely—but they do it in remarkably different ways.

Understanding their differences, integration approaches, and real-world applications isn't just academic. It's crucial for any developer building AI-powered applications that need to execute code securely. Let's dive in and explore what makes these platforms tick.

## Understanding the Landscape

The challenge of securely executing AI-generated code isn't new, but the scale and urgency have exploded in recent years. Traditional approaches—sandboxing in containers or restricting execution—often force you to choose between security and performance. It's like trying to have your cake and eat it too, but ending up with neither.

This is where E2B and Daytona step in, each offering a different philosophy on solving this thorny problem. Think of E2B as the battle-hardened veteran, built for enterprise-scale operations, while Daytona is the nimble startup, optimized for developer productivity. Both are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI code execution, and understanding their approaches will help you choose the right tool for your project.

### What is E2B?

E2B is an open-source cloud infrastructure platform built on **Firecracker microVMs** that lets you run AI-generated code in isolated, secure environments. Trusted by 88% of Fortune 100 companies, E2B has become the go-to solution for organizations needing enterprise-grade code execution capabilities.

What makes E2B special? It's not just another sandbox—it's battle-tested at massive scale. Companies like Perplexity and Hugging Face rely on it for their most demanding workloads. The platform provides SDK support for both Python and JavaScript, making it accessible whether you're a backend engineer or a full-stack developer. And here's the kicker: E2B handles all the heavy lifting of VM management, scaling, and security, so you can focus on what matters—building your application.

Recently, E2B has expanded its capabilities with MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in partnership with Docker, and they've even raised $21M in Series A funding, signaling strong confidence in their vision for AI infrastructure.

### What is Daytona?

Daytona takes a different approach, positioning itself as infrastructure specifically built for AI agents. After pivoting in February 2025 from a development environment platform, Daytona now focuses on providing lightweight, stateful sandboxes optimized for running AI-generated code. Daytona uses standard Docker containers by default but supports enhanced isolation through Kata Containers and Sysbox when needed.

What sets Daytona apart is its developer-first mentality. Imagine spinning up a sandbox in just 90ms—that's faster than you can blink! The platform emphasizes developer experience, offering rapid environment creation and built-in support for Git operations, file system management, and Language Server Protocol (LSP) features. It's like having a full development environment that you can summon instantly.

Daytona has also introduced computer use sandboxes, allowing AI agents to interact with virtual desktops on Linux, Windows, or macOS. This opens up possibilities for agents that need to perform complex UI interactions or run desktop applications. If you're building AI agents that need to "see" and interact with graphical interfaces, Daytona's computer use feature is a game-changer.

## Key Architectural Differences

When it comes to architecture, E2B and Daytona couldn't be more different. It's like comparing a fortress to a speedboat—both get you where you need to go, but they do it in completely different ways. Let's break down what makes each approach unique and why it matters for your AI projects.

### E2B's Firecracker-Based Approach

E2B's architecture revolves around Firecracker, a KVM-based microVM runtime developed by AWS. Each sandbox runs as a lightweight virtual machine with its own isolated kernel, providing true hardware-level isolation. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Superior isolation**: Hardware-level virtualization means malicious code in one sandbox cannot escape to affect the host or other sandboxes
- **Fast cold starts**: Despite being VMs, Firecracker's minimal device model and optimized boot path enable sandbox creation in under 200 milliseconds
- **Pre-warmed snapshots**: E2B uses a sophisticated template-based system with snapshot/restore capabilities for even faster subsequent launches

If you've ever worried about a rogue AI script taking down your entire system, E2B's approach gives you peace of mind. It's the choice when security isn't just important—it's non-negotiable.

### Daytona's Container-First Approach

Daytona's default configuration uses standard Docker containers, which offer familiarity and flexibility for most developers. However, this choice comes with trade-offs:

- **Lighter weight**: Containers are less resource-intensive than microVMs
- **Configuration flexibility**: Teams can enhance isolation through Kata Containers or Sysbox for specific use cases
- **Development-friendly**: Containers integrate seamlessly with existing Docker-based workflows
- **Environmental creation speed**: Daytona's optimized container startup achieves 90ms environment creation

The trade-off is that default container-based isolation, while suitable for most AI agent scenarios, doesn't provide the same level of security guarantees as microVM isolation. If you're prototyping or working with trusted code, this might not matter. But if you're executing code from unverified sources, it's worth considering the security implications.

Think of it this way: E2B gives you a bank vault, while Daytona gives you a locked drawer. Both keep things secure, but one is clearly built for Fort Knox-level protection.


## Integration Workflow in Practice

Enough theory—let's see how these platforms work in the real world. Getting started with either E2B or Daytona is surprisingly straightforward. You'll be up and running in minutes, not hours. Here's what the integration looks like for each platform.

### Getting Started with E2B

Setting up E2B involves straightforward SDK integration. It's as simple as installing a package and writing a few lines of code:

```javascript
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create({ 
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' 
})

// Execute code securely
const result = await sandbox.runPython('print("Hello, E2B!")')
console.log(result.output)

await sandbox.kill()
```

E2B manages the entire lifecycle automatically. You create a sandbox, execute code, and clean up. The platform handles provisioning, isolation, and resource management behind the scenes. It's like having a personal assistant that takes care of all the infrastructure headaches so you can focus on building your AI features.

### Getting Started with Daytona

Daytona's integration is similarly straightforward, with support for both Python and TypeScript. The API feels familiar if you've worked with other cloud platforms:

```typescript
import { Daytona } from '@daytonaio/sdk'

const daytona = new Daytona({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' })

// Create sandbox
const sandbox = await daytona.create({ language: 'typescript' })

// Execute code
const response = await sandbox.process.codeRun('console.log("Hello, Daytona!")')
console.log(response.result)

// Clean up
await daytona.delete(sandbox)
```

Daytona provides additional capabilities beyond basic code execution. The SDK includes native Git operations, file system management, and LSP support, making it a more comprehensive platform for managing development environments as code. If your AI agents need to clone repos, manage files, or even get intelligent code completion, Daytona's got you covered out of the box.


## Comparative Advantages and Drawbacks

Now for the million-dollar question: Which platform should you choose? Like most things in tech, it depends on your specific needs. Let's break down the pros and cons of each, so you can make an informed decision.

### E2B Advantages

**Enterprise adoption**: With 88% of Fortune 100 companies using E2B, it's battle-tested at scale. The platform has executed over 200 million sandboxes and handles millions of concurrent sessions.
